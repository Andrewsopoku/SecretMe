## Motivation

With the advent of Bitcoin, monetary transactions have moved to a phase that has never been seen in the history of humanity. People are able to make payments anonymously without the control of any centralised organisation. Blockchain to some extent, is a technology for the people.

As person who share keen interest in building technologies for an open world, i decided to create a blockchain based texting platform where all messages are sent anonymously and displayed to the world but understandable to only the intended receiver. 

## Block Structure

The first step is deciding on the structure of the blocks. I prefer to keep it as simple as possible.
I include index, timestamp, data, hash and previous hash. Data includes sender public address, recipient public address and encrypted message.
